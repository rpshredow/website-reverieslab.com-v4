            I'm a Computer Science post grad from Eastern Washington University
            that does research in cloud, high performance, and heterogeneous
            computing especially when they apply to machine learning.
            Specifically using GPGPUs (general purpose graphics processing
            units) and FPGAs (Field Programmable Gate Arrays) to accelerate
            computing for scientific computing and machine learning, areas which
            I feel are growing signficantly and will need faster computing in
            the future.

            I graduated from Eastern Washington University with a degree in
            Electrical Engineering in June 2015.
