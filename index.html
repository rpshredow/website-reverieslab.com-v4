    <h1>Welcome to Reveries Lab!</h1>
    <p>
      I'm rebuilding this website from scratch not using any frameworks like
      Django or Laravel, like I did on previous versions of this website or
      using any CSS libraries such as bootstrap. Although I'll probably use
      premade icons and fonts. Also, I won't be using any premade HTML/CSS
      templates.
