            3D Terrain using Three.js

            Use tab to enter the input boxes and use ctrl-v to paste latitude,
            longitude, and zoom. The latitude and longitude of Mt Elbert is
            39.1178 and 106.4452 and the best zooms are between 10 and 15.
          </p>
          <p>
            This project was to turn a AWS public dataset for terrain heights
            into 3D representation using a WebGL wrapper called Three.js.
            Three.js makes using WebGL easier to use. The terrain data is
            represented in .png images whose dimensions are 256x256 where
            terrain heights are decoded from the RGB values.
          </p>
          <p>
            The last three numbers in the URL are the zoom, x tile and y tile,
            https://s3.amazonaws.com/elevation-tiles-prod/terrarium/{z}/{x}/{y}.png.
            The tiles are retrieved by a formula where you input the latitude
            and longitude you want and zoom and it gives the x and y values of
            the tile.
          </p>

        </div>

        <div class="terrain-text">

            The pipeline goes as follows, the user inputs the zoom, latitude and
            longitude of the area they want displayed into the page, that is
            converted to x and y tile values for that zoom value with
            JavaScript. Neighboring tiles are retrieved by adding and
            subtracting from the x and y tile values. Tile zoom, x and y
            coordinate information is sent to a Java Servlet in .json format
            that is located in a AWS EC2 (Amazon Web Services Elastic Compute
            Cloud) instance. The java program retrieves the .png image it then
            decodes the RGB (red, green, blue) values from that .png image and
            gets the height data then sends the height data back to the web app
            in .json format and three.js receives the information and displays a
            tile based on the height data. The app renders the center tile and
            several neighboring tiles.
          </p>
        </div>

          <p>
            Further work that needs to be done is to prefetch information for
            more surrounding tiles and for different zoom levels at that
            location. Multithreaded processing could be used to retrieve and
            decode that information faster. The ideal data structure would be a
            hash table because very zoom, x and y value for each tile is unique
            and hash tables provide a constant time complexity which is very
            fast.
