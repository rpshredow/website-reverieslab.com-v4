            My Masters Thesis is to implement a neural network on an FPGA (Field
            Programmable Gate Array) and do so using a unique numbering and math

            math this neural network will be implemented using a Tally Numbering
            System. The essence of the tally numbering systems is that the
            number of 1s in a bit string represents the number. The purpose of
            this numbering system and the associated math is to decrease
            computation time / hardware used / energy used over conventional
            floating point and fixed point operations.
          </p>
          <p>
            The most significant bit represents the sign, 0 for positive and 1
            for negative.
          </p>
          <p>
            Addition and Subtraction is accomplished by bit shifting left or
            right. Bit shifting is computationally cheap and can be implemented
            with just a barrel shifter. As opposed to all the logic required for
            basic addition and subtraction in floating and fixed point. Addition
            can also be done by performing bitwise OR on two bit strings,
            conversely subtraction can also be accomplished by performing
            bitwise AND on the two bit strings.

            00001111 + 00000011 = 00111111 (4 + 2 = 6) the result is just 4 bit
            shifted to the left 2 spots and bitwise OR with 2.

          <h4>Fractional Representation using Tally Numbering System</h4>
          <p>
            Fractional number representation, which I created, is done by
            picking a number for the total number of bits to be used such as 16,
            plus a signed bit. Note that choosing a large number may consume a
            lot of hardware and choosing a small number may reduce accuracy and
            cause errors. When all 16 bits are equal to 1 then that represents a
            1, when all bits are 0 then that represents a 0, everything in
            between represents fractions such as eight 0s and eight 1s is equal
            to 0.5 and twelve 0s and four 1s equals 0.25.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mathematical Operations are the same as before. Fitting data to this
            system is just rounding to the nearest fraction.

          <p>0000000011111111 = 8</p>

            Multiplication and Division is done by reflecting the bit string
            through a matrix with a slope of the number that is being multiplied
            or divided by. This is implemented using a look up table because
            implementing an efficient line drawing algorithm would require
            multiplier blocks where the point of the talley numbering system is
            to reduce or eliminate the used of multiplier blocks to increase
            speed and reduce hardware used.

          <h4>Neural Network Architecture</h4>
          <p>
            The neural net will be a basic feed forward network at first using
            pre calculated weights used from a separate multi-layer perceptron
            that was trained on the MNIST data.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently I'm working on a multi-layer perceptron to implement on
            the FPGA. The perceptron will consist of 3 layers, and input layer
            of 784 nodes because each MNIST image is 28x28 which equals 784, the
            hidden layers is 100 which is arbitrary as hyper parameters in
            machine learning are and the output layer is 10 nodes for each of
            the 10 numbers.
