          My Masters Thesis is to implement a neural network on an FPGA (Field
          Programmable Gate Array) and do so using a unique numbering and math
          system thought up by my graduate advisor Kosuke Imamura. The thesis
          will be using the

          math this neural network will be implemented using a Tally Numbering
          System. The essence of the tally numbering systems is that the number
          of 1s in a bit string represents the number. The purpose of this
          numbering system and the associated math is to decrease computation
          time / hardware used / energy used over conventional floating point
          and fixed point operations.

        <p style="color: black">
          The most significant bit represents the sign, 0 for positive and 1 for
          negative.
        </p>
        <p style="color: black">00011111 = 5</p>
        <p style="color: black">10001111 = -4.</p>
        <p style="color: black">
          Addition and Subtraction is accomplished by bit shifting left or
          right. Bit shifting is computationally cheap and can be implemented
          with just a barrel shifter. As opposed to all the logic required for
          basic addition and subtraction in floating and fixed point.
        </p>
        <p style="color: black">
          00001111 + 00000011 = 00111111 (4 + 2 = 6) the result is just 4 bit
          shifted to the left 2 spots and bitwise OR with 2.
        </p>
        <p style="color: black">
          Multiplication and Division is done by reflecting the bit string
          through a matrix with a slope of the number that is being multiplied
          or divided by. This is implemented using a look up table because
          implementing an efficient line drawing algorithm would require
          multiplier blocks where the point of the talley numbering system is to
          reduce or eliminate the used of multiplier blocks to increase speed
          and reduce hardware used.

          Fractional Representation using Tally Numbering System
        </h6>
        <p style="color: black">
          Fractional number representation, which I created, is done by picking
          a number for the total number of bits to be used such as 16, plus a
          signed bit. Note that choosing a large number may consume a lot of
          hardware and choosing a small number may reduce accuracy and cause
          errors. When all 16 bits are equal to 1 then that represents a 1, when
          all bits are 0 then that represents a 0, everything in between
          represents fractions such as eight 0s and eight 1s is equal to 0.5 and
          twelve 0s and four 1s equals 0.25.
        </p>
        <p style="color: black">1111111111111111 = 1</p>
        <p style="color: black">0000000000000000 = 0</p>
        <p style="color: black">0000000011111111 = 8</p>
        <p style="color: black">0000000000001111 = 0.25</p>
        <p style="color: black">
          Mathematical Operations are the same as before. Fitting data to this
          system is just rounding to the nearest fraction.

        <h5 class="mb-3 mt-5 font-weight-bold">Neural Network Architecture</h5>
        <p style="color: black">
          Currently I'm working on a multi-layer perceptron to implement on the
          FPGA. The perceptron will consist of 3 layers, and input layer of 784
          nodes because each MNIST image is 28x28 which equals 784, the hidden
          layers is 100 which is arbitrary as hyper parameters in machine
          learning are and the output layer is 10 nodes for each of the 10
          numbers.

          <img src="/media/mnist_2layers.png" alt="" class="img-fluid" />
        </p>
        <p style="color: black">
          The neural net will be a basic feed forward network at first using pre
          calculated weights used from a separate multi-layer perceptron that
          was trained on the MNIST data.
